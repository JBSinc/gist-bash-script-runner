  Gist Bash Script Runner
summary: |
  Retrieves and runs bash scripts that are stored in a Gist
description: |
  This step is for running bash scripts that are stored in a Gist. This is very similar to the remote bash script runner provided by the Bitrise team. However, this step differs in that it takes the root Gist URL, instwad of the "raw" Gist URL. The step automatically extracts the raw URL from the content located at the root Gist URL. Additionally, because Gists can contain multiple files, this step will retrieve the contents of _every_ file in the Gist and attempt to run them as bash scripts.

        Defaults to *true*. If *true*, the step will exit with if any of the remote gist files fail to load or return a failure code (exit > 0). If *false*, subsequent gist files will attempt to load, even if previous ones fail. Note that Gists can contain more than one file.
